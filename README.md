# daenom
A IFTTT endpoint that retrieves media files from Twitter and Tumblr.

Multi-image posts are stiched into a single image using iMagick, and there is support for handling gif/mp4 media.

The purpose of this software is to produce a single file to an IFTTT query. This file can then be shared, emailed, stored to a cloud drive, etc.

The ultimate goal of this software is to automatically archive image/video from posts that I have liked to a inspiration repository. Attribution and file name handling is done via IFTTT.
